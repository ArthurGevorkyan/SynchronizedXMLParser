# SynchronizedXMLParser
A subclass of the standard NSXMLParser from Cocoa that helps you avoid unintended reentrant parsing.

This repository contains only one .swift file and is straightforward and simple to use:
- You just copy it into your project and
- Use instances of SynchronizedXMLParser as if they are of NSXMLParser.
No additional efforts required, just profit :)

P. S. The content of the .swift file is absolutely free of any kind of license. Please feel free to use as is, modify and distribute it in any form. A reference to the author would be much appreciated though.
